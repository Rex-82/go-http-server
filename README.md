This is my solution to the ["Build Your Own HTTP server" CodeCrafter Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) implemented in Go.

This aims to provide an HTTP/1.1 server that is capable of serving multiple clients at once (by using goroutines).

1. Ensure you have `go (1.19)` installed locally.
2. Run `./your_server.sh` to run the program, which is implemented in `app/server.go`.
3. Use `curl` to test functionalities.
